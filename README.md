# Fairphone RSS assignment


We recommend spending about four to six hours on the assignment, but you can take the time you need.


Please do not feel too stressed to complete all items. Assessment does not just include your
solution, but project structuring, choosen architecture, naming conventions 
and how the project grows over time as seen in your commit history.


The project can be found at `https://gitlab.com/fairphone/rss-android-app.git`


Please fork the project in gitlab, and then clone it from the fork using the following command:
`git clone git@gitlab.fairphone.software:YOUR_USERNAME/RssAndroidApp.git`

Or create a new branch with the following name:
`assignment/[YOUR_USERNAME]` and push all your changes to that branch
